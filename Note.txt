
NOTES

sorry for the delay in getting this back, we are currently in the middle of moving house, and everything
is slightly up in the air.

Please note, I still have a few unit tests to finish.. however I wanted to get this accross asap
There is a Swagger frontend for testing, (I'd normally do documentation on something like Confluance for the API)

unfortunately the PC i've used for this test, did not enable me to run Visual studio as admin, this 
prevented me from using/testing Service Fabric, however, as I'm sure your aware, this this is really
just a wrapper (offering many advantages, and could easily be added later).

other things todo: Security... Currently this has not been implemented - mainly due to time presures.
hopefully theres enough here to gauge my thought processes?

Happy to discuss further at interview?


Kind Regards
